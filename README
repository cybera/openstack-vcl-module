This is an updated version of the module that can be found here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VCL-590 by Young-Hyun. It may not work with all OpenStack + VCL systems.

NOTE: This module assumes you are using openstack and NAT and that your managment node is in the same tenant as the entire system, and that your management nnode has an openstack display name of vcl-prod. We hope to change this in the future so that the openstack.pm module uses UUIDs to delete instances rather than grepping for IP addresses based on what it stored in /etc/hosts.
